    <h1>Chicken Tenders with Balsamic-Fig Sauce</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Drizzled over chicken, this textural fig sauce is made with balsamic vinegar which is a nice contrast to the sweet figs. Thyme provides just a bit of savoriness to the sweet, rich sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Chicken</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound chicken tenders</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ cup red wine</li>
        <li>¼ cup balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>4 fresh figs, cut into ½-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the chicken: Season chicken with salt and pepper on both sides, then lightly coat with flour, shaking off excess.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil and butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until tenders are golden brown, no longer pink in the centers, and the juices run clear, 5 to 6 minutes, flipping halfway through. Transfer to a plate and cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Add shallot and garlic to the same skillet and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Add red wine and balsamic vinegar; simmer until reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in figs, thyme, mustard, honey, and salt; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low or medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in butter.</li>
        <li>Spoon sauce over warm chicken tenders, or add chicken back to the skillet to briefly reheat. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
